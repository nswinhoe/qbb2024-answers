##Complete the following exercises using a combination of cut, sort, uniq, and grep

```{r}
#Tally the number of each gene_biotype in hg38-gene-metadata-feature.tsv. 
cut -f 7 hg38-gene-metadata-feature.tsv | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
# there are 39


#How many protein_coding genes are there? 

$ cut -f 7 hg38-gene-metadata-feature.tsv | sort | grep "protein_coding" | wc -l 
#There are 19618

#Pick one biotype you would want to learn more about and explain why.

```



```{r}
#Which ensembl_gene_id in hg38-gene-metadata-go.tsv has the most go_ids? 

cut -f 1 hg38-gene-metadata-go.tsv | uniq -c | sort -n

# 273 ENSG00000168036



#Create a new file that only contains rows corresponding to that gene_id, sorting the rows according to the name_1006 column. 

 grep "ENSG00000168036" hg38-gene-metadata-go.tsv | sort -n > ENSG00000168036.txt


#Describe what you think this gene does based on the GO terms.


```
